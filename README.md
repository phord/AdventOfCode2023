# Advent of Code 2023 solutions

- Run the last solution with: `cargo run --release`
- Run all solutions with: `cargo run --release -- -a`

- Run the benchmarks with: `cargo bench --bench aoc-bench`

## Implementing solutions
Solutions are in src/day\*.rs.
See src/example.rs for an example with unit tests.

1. Uncomment the Part1 code, implement it and run the test.
2. When it works, run the Part1 code with real input using `cargo run --release`
3. Repeat for Part2

### Unit testing:
Store sample data in the code directly.  It's not available to download.
Assign expected values to ANS1 and ANS2.
